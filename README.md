## 🧐About

MAC-PER introduces [PER](https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.05952) and PER with buffer sharing on multi agent settings. We test our solution on the [Pursuit Environment](https://www.pettingzoo.ml/sisl/pursuit) using the Petting-zoo API. We procide three different modes of implementation. 

## 💡Features

The project provides implementation of:
1. Standart DDQN agents.
2. PER based agents.
3. PER with buffer shraing between the agents.

## ⛏️Built with

-   Keras
-   TensorFlow 2
-   PettingZoo
-   Panda
-   Pickle
