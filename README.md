## 🧐About

MAC PER offers an introduction to PER and multi agent settings using the Petting-zoo API. We test our solution on the [Pursuit Environment](https://www.pettingzoo.ml/sisl/pursuit) with three different modes of implementation. 

## 💡Features

The projects provide implementation of:
1. Standart DDQN agents.
2. PER based agents.
3. PER with buffer shraing between the agents.

## ⛏️Built with

-   Keras
-   TensorFlow 2
-   PettingZoo
-   Panda
-   Pickle
